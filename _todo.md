# Getting started with Github for classroom

* Create new organization per class/term
* Create a `class-logistics` repo in this organization. 
* Collect student github usernames (put in CSV for large classes)
* Add students to github classroom 
    - Add them to a `all-students` team
    - Give this team write access to `class-logistics`
    
* Add first assignment. 
    - Create starter code repo for basic RMD site
    - Send assignment link to class via slack

-----

* Effort based grading like S20
    - Where to show grid to students? -> Individual student repo containing R data set of assignments, grades, and % effort. Single RMD file that creates a nice table for them when they knit.
  
* class credit for hosting community coding?

* github classroom
    - ISLR assignments in separate repos like last time
    - `class-notes` repo open to all as listed above.
        - Individual RMD files for reading questions (ISLR & others)
        - Set up as a website. Let the students collaborate to add/modify items to this webpage. 

* Coding Homework
  - probably sent out via github classroom
  - upload compiled homework as PDF to google drive

* learning journal
    - 321-bridge
    - reading reflections. Ask several questions, ask each student to share one insight from the reading that they want their fellow students to hear. 
    
* Schedule time/bonus pts for DataFest
* How to schedule a screening of Coded Bias?
