* Add students to github classroom 
    - Add them to a `all-students` team
    - Give this team write access to `class-logistics`
    
* Add first assignment.

-----

* Effort based grading like S20
    - Where to show grid to students? -> Individual student repo containing R data set of assignments, grades, and % effort. Single RMD file that creates a nice table for them when they knit.
  
* class credit for hosting community coding

* github classroom
    - ISLR assignments in separate repos like last time
    
* Collaborative notes still in Hackmd, git connected to course repo. 
    - Individual RMD files for reading questions (ISLR & others)

* Coding Homework
  - sent out via github classroom
  - upload compiled homework as PDF to google drive

* learning journal
    - 321-bridge
    - reading reflections. Ask several questions, ask each student to share one insight from the reading that they want their fellow students to hear. 
    
* Schedule time/bonus pts for DataFest
* How to schedule a screening of Coded Bias?
