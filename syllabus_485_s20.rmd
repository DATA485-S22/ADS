## Interdisciplinary Collaboration Project

We will be doing a joint project with Political Science Graduate students (POLS 624). 
The project will be a twitter analysis of public opinion. You will work with a team of PolSci students, where you will provide technical and coding support and they are the content experts. 

We will also have a joint Slack channel with this class, and you will be helping them learn R through a series of reviews of their "Learn R (Math 130)" homework assignments, and attending Community Coding. 

More details can be found on the Project page of the course website.
