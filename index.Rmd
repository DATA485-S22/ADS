### Week 2: Finding your place in the DS world

* Your first assignment is due by Monday EOD. The peer review starting order is in the #assignments Slack channel. 
    - We'll walk through the peer review via pull request $PR^2$ in class. 
* Tuesday we're going to talk about the DDS readings - be prepared to answer the questions written on [week 1](https://norcalbiostat.github.io/ADS/wk01.html#doing_data_science_-_readings).
* Then it's all about getting your professional webpage started. 
  - Start simple. Don't let choice paralysis hit you. 



### Week 1: Welcome! 

* Class time will be split between discussion of current topics, and you working on assignments. 
* Often you will be presented with a set of questions to answer while doing the readings, that we will discuss in class. These will be posted on the weekly details. 
* Explore the website, get your system updated if needed, and check the schedule week 1 to see what new programs you'll need to get and/or update.
