# Announcements

### Week 1: Welcome! 

* Class time will be split between discussion of current topics, and you working on assignments. 
* Often you will be presented with a set of questions to answer while doing the readings, that we will discuss in class. These will be posted on the weekly details. 
* Explore the website, get your system updated if needed, and check the schedule week 1 to see what new programs you'll need to get and/or update.
