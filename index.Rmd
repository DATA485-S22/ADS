### Week 1: Welcome! 

* Most of the time spent in class will be 60% your work time and 40% me yammering. Especially during this semester due to the class size. 
* Explore the website, get your system updated if needed, and check the schedule week 1 to see what new programs you'll need to get and/or update.
