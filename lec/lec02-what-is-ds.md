# How do I get started? 
No two paths are the same, but you're already very much on your way. Lifelong learning is the key, as is the desire to sit and tinker with things. 

Following people/news on Social media/blogs is also a great way to keep up with current news and topics, and to learn about new things. 

As you get closer to graduating (next year?), and thinking about those next steps, start googling topics like _"How to become a Data Scientist"_, and _"Data Science skillset"_. (Make sure you filter to show articles in the past year.)

Here are a few articles that stood out to me
* https://towardsdatascience.com/compilation-of-advice-for-new-and-aspiring-data-scientists-5ea75a3925c4
* https://www.tableau.com/learn/articles/data-science-skills
* https://insights.dice.com/2019/11/20/how-to-become-a-data-scientist/


:exclamation: remember... these articles are someone's opinion from their perspective, in their sector.

You are not going to meet _all_ criteria, you are not a unicorn, but you are a beautiful and unique scientist. :muscle: Your DS profile will change, it will grow as you learn new things. Your path will be unique depending on your skillset and desires. 

Of course there are a common set of skills and knowledges that you need, and thats what this DS Certificate aims to provide you with at least the start of.
