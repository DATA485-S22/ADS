:question: When was Data Science at the top of the Hype cycle? 

* 2017

* 2020 ![](http://makemeanalyst.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/09/Language-Trend-Machine-Learning-DataScience.png)

:busts_in_silhouette: Give an example of _datafication_ that affects you personaly. 

* [Madeline] Phone tracking screen time to recommend certain apps they anticipate and will want to use at their predicted time.
* [Kris] My smart phone using my current location to suggest restaurants, activities, etc.
* [Irfan] Remote sensing of agriculural systems for dynamic irrigation and fertilizer application. Land use and management data can potentially be used against the landowner to enforce regulations. For example, the controversial topic in California agriculture is nitrogen fertilizer application budgeting to adhere to water regulations.
* [Tanya] Social media accounts (e.g Facebook, Twitter). I've gotten more personalized ads after following certain accounts, such as Elon Musk and some front-end devs on Twitter.
* [Kaleb] High School sports news articles (max preps). This is information that the schools put online about how their students have done in their sports programs, and does not require the consent of the student.
* [Brandon] Personalized ads related to what I search for on the internet. It makes me question what ways they were able to obtain this data. One time I said the words "Pizza Guys" about 50 times in my text messages and then got Pizza Guys ads.
* [Collin] Now when I go hiking or camping my friends and family require I have a GPS so I don't get lost/ they can track me
* [Olivia] Amazon's frontpage giving me ads for different types of novelty snack foods after someone showed me [Pumpkin Spice flavored SPAM](https://www.amazon.com/SPAM-Pumpkin-Spice-Ounce-Can/dp/B07YCLKPZC)
# What is a Data Scientist? 

:busts_in_silhouette: Find an answer to the question "What is a Data Scientist" for each year prior to now. Let's see how far back we can go in a reasonable amount of time. Include the URL of your finding as a link. 

* 2020 [Kaleb] A data scientist's job is to derive patterns and meaning from large data sets to help drive strategic business. AI will be functioning as the Assistant of a Data Scientist, allowing for more advanced analysis and predictions. https://www.information-management.com/opinion/what-the-data-scientist-role-will-look-like-in-2020
* 2019 [Kris] "The division between Data Science and product management is gradually disappearing, though the limiting term “data scientist” does not reflect the actual work roles of experts employed as data scientists. There is a lot of confusion about the scope of this job title, resulting in diverse roles and responsibilities in workplaces today."
* https://www.dataversity.net/data-science-trends-in-2019/
* 2018: [Kris] "Specialization is becoming more important. While there is no well-defined career path for data scientists, and little support for junior data scientists, we are starting to see some forms of specialization. Emily Robinson described the difference between Type A and Type B data scientists: “Type A is the analysis — sort of a traditional statistician — and Type B is building machine learning models."

* 2014: [irfan] ["While a data scientist has the capability to do much of the same work as a data analyst or BI practitioner, his or her primary
focus is statistical analysis, be it predictive model development, machine learning or data mining. And what sets data scientists apart from pure statisticians is their computer programming
ability used to manage large data sets along with their domain knowledge, which they use to guide their analysis"](https://www.cbigconsulting.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/03/data-scientist.pdf)

* 2011: [Madeline] [“By definition all scientists are data scientists. In my opinion, they are half hacker, half analyst, they use data to build products and find insights. It’s Columbus meet Columbo – starry eyed explorers and skeptical detectives.”](https://www.forbes.com/sites/danwoods/2011/11/27/linkedins-monica-rogati-on-what-is-a-data-scientist/#cc194163e157)

# How do I get started? 
No two paths are the same, but you're already very much on your way. Lifelong learning is the key, as is the desire to sit and tinker with things. 

Following people/news on Social media/blogs is also a great way to keep up with current news and topics, and to learn about new things. 

As you get closer to graduating (next year?), and thinking about those next steps, start googling topics like _"How to become a Data Scientist"_, and _"Data Science skillset"_. (Make sure you filter to show articles in the past year.)

Here are a few articles that stood out to me
* https://towardsdatascience.com/compilation-of-advice-for-new-and-aspiring-data-scientists-5ea75a3925c4
* https://www.tableau.com/learn/articles/data-science-skills
* https://insights.dice.com/2019/11/20/how-to-become-a-data-scientist/


:exclamation: remember... these articles are someone's opinion from their perspective, in their sector.

You are not going to meet _all_ criteria, you are not a unicorn, but you are a beautiful and unique scientist. :muscle: Your DS profile will change, it will grow as you learn new things. Your path will be unique depending on your skillset and desires. 

Of course there are a common set of skills and knowledges that you need, and thats what this DS Certificate aims to provide you with at least the start of.
