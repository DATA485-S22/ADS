## Real Estate Website Case Study

Chapter 2 of Doing Data Science

### Questions?

* Are we trying to predict sales price?
    * No. The purpose is to create an easier way to interact not predict an outcome.
    * Read the 2nd bullet point of #2
* Are we highlighting specific features (good schools, near park)?
    * If we find interesting things to highlight during our data analysis then yes.
* Who are our buyers / sellers?
* What type of visualizations should we consider?
    * It depends entirely on what question we are trying to answer. Once we have the question we know the data we need and the visual to go with it 
* Do we care about making predictions or just viewing the current state? (i.e. inferential statistics or exploration/descriptive analysis)
    * Since this is the "first" step we care about an exploration/descriptive analysis. If there were a second phase this would depict whether we care to go down the route of inferential statistics.

* What forces Realtors to use RealDirect?
* How might the potential unintended consequences have an effect on the product(web app UI)?
* What's a data strategy?

* What do you mean by playground code file?
* Can we identify holes in the data RealDirect has access to?
* How much external info regarding neighborhood?
    * This and the two above questions deal with the potential that we are missing data, and the ramifications that could bring.
