# Learning Objectives

* Recognize the minimal requirements to build a website using R and Markdown. 
* Build a basic level website using R and Markdown
* Publish this website to GitHub


----

# Getting started

R Markdown websites like the class website one can be built with a minimum of two files: a `_site.yml` and an `index.Rmd`. 

The `_site.yml` file controls the overall structure of the website, such as the order of the navigation bar and the color theme. 

When these files are _rendered_ into HTML files, they can be hosted on GitHub for free. Then after turning on a few settings in your GitHub repository (repo) these files can be viewed as a magnificent webpage. 

We are going to employ the "[GitHub first, R Studio second](https://happygitwithr.com/new-github-first.html)" approach. 

### 1. Clone the `Basic RMarkdown Website` repo in our Github Classroom. 

This will give you the starter files mentioned above. 


### 2. Create a project in R Studio and clone your new repo into this project. 

* Top right corner in R Studio click: *New Project --> Checkout from version control --> Git*
* Go back to GitHub, and click on the green <span style="color:green">[Clone or Download]</span> button.
  - Click the clipboard icon to copy the URL to your repo. 
  - Paste this URL into the _Repository URL_ box in R Studio. 
    * **(_Strongly Suggested_)**: Name this project the same as the repo name.
    * Subdirectory: Your path, your choice. Just don't put a repo inside a repo. 
* Click _Create Project_


* Open both the `_site.yml` and `index.Rmd` files now. 

### 4. Configuring the `_site.yml` file. 
This is the file that controls your overall site's configuration. If you are familiar with R Markdown files, this is the same type of 'language' that is used in the header area to control the document structure. 

YAML headers, and this file, are very particular about spacing and tabs. 

* Give your website a name and title!


### 5. Configure your index page. 

This is your landing page. That is, the first page people see when they go to your website. You can add a title to this page using a YAML header as is shown in the bookdown website, or you can use a pound sign `#` as a first level header to make this title. 

* Create a title for your page using *either* a YAML header or a `#` sign. Using both is redundant. 
* Write a sentence or two welcoming your viewers to your website. 

### 6. Building & previewing your website locally. 

Since we added the `.yml` file manually after creating the R Project, your project doesn't quite know yet thatit has a website to build. 


* Save your work and close down R studio. 
* Navigate to your repository folder on your computer, and open the project by double clicking on the R project file icon (a cube with the letter R). 
    - _Note: This is always how you should open your R Project files_

There should now be a **BUILD** tab in the top right pane.

* Click this tab, and then click the _Build Website_ button. 

An HTML file should now appear in your viewer pane. 

* Click the 'Show in new window' button to see your site in a full browser window. 


#### Notes, Tips and Comments - 

* Clicking "Build Website" will render every `.md` and `.Rmd` file in your top level project folder into an HTML file. 
    - This is important to keep in mind when creating a website with a lot of pages. 
    - Code files in sub-folders will not be automatically rendered. 
* You can re-render individual files by clicking 'Knit'. 
* You can leave this browser window open as you work, refreshing the page to see new changes. 
* There are some basic themes you can app

```
output:
  html_document:
    theme: readable
    highlight: pygments
```    


* Try this now. Make a change to your `index.Rmd`, knit and refresh your browser window. 
 
### 7. Push to GitHub & publish your website. 

Let's get your test site up for the world to see. 


* In the _Terminal_ window, stage and commit your files to version control by executing the following commands:

```
git add -A 
```

This will _stage_ all files that have been changed and/or added. _Staging_ is the process of adding a file to be tracked under version control. 

```
git commit -m "first commit"
```

Every commit needs a message. Try to make it informative, yet brief. 

```
git push
```

This will _push_ your changes up to GitHub's servers online. You may have to enter your github username and password here. See [happy git with R](https://happygitwithr.com/push-pull-github.html) for help storing your github credentials. 


* Go back to your GitHub repo page and refresh - you should now see that your repo now contains the new code, and HTML files that you have been working on. 
* Click _Settings_ in the top right of the navigation bar in your repository. 
    - Scroll down to the **GitHub Pages** section. 
    - Under _Source_, select _Master branch_. (_Note: [Chapter 3.3 of the bookdown manual](https://bookdown.org/yihui/blogdown/github-pages.html) has instructions for publishing something other than the top level folder for a repo, such as a `public` folder_)
    
After the page refreshes, you will see the URL to your website in at the top of GitHub pages section. 

* Click on this link to see what your public facing website looks like!
* Copy this URL, we're going to paste it in the repo settings so it can be found easy. 
* Go back to your main repo page by clicking on the name of your repo at the top of the GitHub page. 
    - Click **Edit**
    - Add a short description, and paste the URL into the _Website_ field. 


### 8. Adding Content. 

Let's add an example analysis project to showcase on our website. 


* Go back to R Studio. 
    - Create a new R Markdown file using _File -> New R Markdown_ so we can get the example R Markdown content that includes a plot. 
    - Save this file with a name such as `project.Rmd`
    - Knit this file to produce a HTML file. 
* Add a link to the project HTML page to your `_site.yml` configuration file by adding a new `text` line. Be mindful about the spacing here. 

```
    - text: "My Projects"
      href: project.html
```

* Rebuild your website by clicking the _Build Website_ button in the _Build_ tab in the top right pane.
* View your changes locally, make a change if you see fit. 
* Add your changes to version control from the Terminal: 

```
git add -A
git commit -m "add project"
git push
```

* Refresh your live webpage on GitHub to see the results!
