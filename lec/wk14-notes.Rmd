# Learning Path

### Where we've been

* Multivariable model building using linear and logistic regression. 
* Basic concepts surrounding flexible vs rigid, parametric vs non-parametric estimates of $f$. 
* Basic concepts of prediction and classification. Target measures of fit. 
* Wrangling and exploring text data
* Classification models other than logistic regression. Starting simple with discriminant analysis and naive Bayes. (ISLR Ch 4)
* Employing resampling methods such as cross validation to improve our prediction accuracy (ISLR Ch 5)
* Estimating accuracy using the bootstrap (ISLR Ch 5.2)
* Working with the `caret` package to conduct a machine learning algorithm to classify data under a variety of models. 

### Where we're at

* Topic modeling of text data - making predictions using text.  (Skipping because of time constraints)
* Ethics of Predictive models and artificial intelligence. 
* Tree based methods for classification (ISLR Ch 8)

# Goals for this week. 

* Project 
    - Analysis should be wrapping up. 
    - This week, work on conclusion and discussion. 
    - Final peer review starts next Sunday. 
* Start [Weapons of Math Destruction (WMD)](https://chico-primo.hosted.exlibrisgroup.com/permalink/f/jik37n/01CALS_ALMA71384958140002901)
* Start reading ILSR Ch8 on Tree based models. Lecture notes are [[here]](lec/lec09-tree-models.html)
    - Last homework assignment. Due 5/15. [[Github repo assignment link TBD]]()

# Housekeeping 

* Class is not officially held on Tuesday. I will be around, but possibly may leave at a moments notice. 
* I notified you via Slack on Tuesday to start reading/listening to the WMD book.
    - The reading & writing assignment schedule is below. 
* Additional (optional) readings on Ethics & Algorithms have been added to the [materials](materials.html) page.

# WMD Reading Schedule
Each set of 2 chapters has a few [reflection questions](read/WMD_Discussion_Questions.html). Choose one of these questions to answer in your Learning Journal by the due date. We will share out in class each day next week. 

* Intro & Ch 1 - Due Fri 5/1
* Ch 2 & 3  - Due Fri 5/8
* Ch 4 & 5 OR 6 & 7 - Due Fri 5/15
