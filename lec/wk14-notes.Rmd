# Learning Path

### Where we've been

* Multivariable model building using linear and logistic regression. 
* Basic concepts surrounding flexible vs rigid, parametric vs non-parametric estimates of $f$. 
* Basic concepts of prediction and classification. Target measures of fit. 
* Wrangling and exploring text data
* Classification models other than logistic regression. Starting simple with discriminant analysis and naive Bayes. (ISLR Ch 4)
* Employing resampling methods such as cross validation to improve our prediction accuracy (ISLR Ch 5)
* Estimating accuracy using the bootstrap (ISLR Ch 5.2)
* Working with the `caret` package to conduct a machine learning algorithm to classify data under a variety of models. 

### Where we're at

* Topic modeling of text data - making predictions using text.  (Skipping because of time constraints)
* Ethics of Predictive models and artificial intelligence. 
* Tree based methods for classification (ISLR Ch 8)

# Goals for this week. 

* Project 
    - Analysis should be wrapping up. 
    - This week, work on conclusion and discussion. 
    - Final peer review starts next Sunday. 
* Start reading Weapons of Math Destruction
* Start reading ILSR Ch8 on Tree based models.

# Housekeeping 

* Class is not officially held on Tuesday. I will try to be around, but my dog is having surgery that day and so I don't know when he'll be done/need to be picked up etc. 
* We will be doing an in class discussion on WMD for part of Tuesday. 
    - You will have at least one reflective writing assignment out of this book (to be done in your Learning Journal)
