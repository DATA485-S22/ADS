# Learning Path

### Where we've been

* Multivariable model building using linear and logistic regression. 
* Basic concepts surrounding flexible vs rigid, parametric vs non-parametric estimates of $f$. 
* Basic concepts of prediction and classification. Target measures of fit. 
* Wrangling and exploring text data
* Classification models other than logistic regression. Starting simple with discriminant analysis and naive Bayes. (ISLR Ch 4)
* Employing resampling methods such as cross validation to improve our prediction accuracy (ISLR Ch 5)
* Estimating accuracy using the bootstrap (ISLR Ch 5.2)
* Working with the `caret` package to conduct a machine learning algorithm to classify data under a variety of models. 

### Where we're at

* Ethics of Predictive models and artificial intelligence. 
* Tree based methods for classification (ISLR Ch 8)

# Goals for this week. 

* Project - Peer review final slides
* Reading Weapons of Math Destruction 
* Continue through ILSR Ch8 on Tree based models.

# Tuesday

* Discussing WMD Intro & Ch1. What makes a WMD? 
* Best (Agriculture) practices - keep those trees pruned. Better for the tree, better for the fruit. 
* Remember you're responsible for all the questions from the book, not just the ones that you answered in class.

# Thursday

* Discussing WMD CH 2 & 3. 
* Building and pruning trees in R using `caret`.
