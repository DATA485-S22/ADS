# Learning Objectives

* Become aware of how the `blogdown` R package can be used to create responsive websites
* Download and compile a starter website based on blogdown. 

----

The "simple" website that was built last time can be extended and enhanced well enough with some CSS and Rmarkdown wizardry. However, sometimes you may want a little more of a 'modern', 'dynamic' or 'responsive' feel, or to include a blog in your website. Here are some examples:

This is when we enter the realm of [[Hugo]](https://gohugo.io/), - the self proclaimed "most popular open-source static site generator". 

Hugo is it's own language, and for advanced usage of Hugo-based websites, some understanding of how Hugo works and reading _those_ docs may be required. 

For now, we are just going to show you how to get started in this realm of fancy-ness using the R package `blogdown`. Then you can go break it later. The super official blogdown documentation is linked in the References section at the bottom of this page.  

If you did not do so beforehand, install the `blogdown` package, and use it to install Hugo using `blogdown::install_hugo()`. 

### 1. Clone the `Blogdown website` repo in our Github Classroom. 

There is no starter code because this is just an assignment shell. 

1. Add a `README` file
2. Clone to R studio using a new project. 


### 2. Create a new site with a specified theme

The `blogdown` package will setup the necessary files, folder structures and theme files from a pre-specified them that is available on github. The example we will start with is a very simple site containing a few pages and a blog. 


```{r, eval=FALSE}
blogdown::new_site(theme='yihui/hugo-lithium')
```

This could take up to a minute to download all necessary files. 

When it is done, your website will be rendered and appear in the bottom right viewer pane. Click the 'Show in new window' to open it in your full browser. 


### 3. Explore configuration files. 
Let's start by looking at the files that are contained in the root folder of this project. 

* `index.Rmd`: Nothing really is there! This is one of the primary differences between this type of site building and the one we just finished. Content is handled in a very different manner. Hugo + Blogdown aim to help you focus on content creation and these programs put the pieces together for you.

* `config.toml`: Functions similar to the `_site.yml` file, you can think of TOML as having the same functionality as the YAML, but with different syntax. TOML uses a key-value pair of options, such as

```
title = "A Hugo website"
```

Areas of the website, like the menu (navbar), are controlled in sections that start with brackets and look like the following: 

```
[[menu.main]]
    name = "About"
    url = "/about/"
```

* Remove the twitter link
* Change the GitHub link to point to your GitHub account
* Give your site a different title. 

`r emo::ji("question")` Were you able to see the results of each of the changes you made on the live site? 


### 4. Explore and modify static content files. 

Open the `content` folder. Right now there is only an `about.md` file. **Open this file**. 

We see a familiar YAML header, and a body of text. 

* Change the title and content. 
* Save this file, go back to your local site and refresh the live preview to see the changes. 

This folder is where we can add more static pages, such as a CV. Since we are not using any R code here, we can stick with the simpler markdown only file format. 


* Copy the `about.md` file, rename this as `cv.md`. 
  - You can do this in R Studio by clicking the box to the left of the file name in the Files window, then clicking _More --> Copy_
* Change the title, add a few bullet points and save. 
* Go back to the `config.toml` file, and add a new ``[[menu.main]]` section as shown below so that this link shows up in the navbar.

```
[[menu.main]]
    name = "CV"
    url = "/cv/"
```


### 5. Blog posts

On your newly updated website, clicking on the icon in the top left. This will take you back to the landing page. For this theme, the landing page is a blog (instead of a static page such as `About`). Clicking on one of these posts takes you to the page that contains the post itself. 

The content files for posts are stored under `content/post/` folder. If you look there now you'll see some markdown (`.md`), some R Markdown (`.Rmd`) files, and their associated `.html` output files. 


* Option 1: Copy/paste/modify one of the example files already in this folder. 
* Option 2: Use the R Studio Addins to setup the page structure for you. 
    - **This is the one we're going to use**
    - Using the UI allows you to easily set catgories, tags and the like. 
    
    
* Click _Addins --> New Post_
  - This will likely require you to install and/or update new packages including (but not limited to) 
    `fastmap`, `miniUI`, `htmltools`, `shiny`. 
  - If you run into seemingly endless package installation loops, restart RStudio and re-try. 
* Give your post a title, author name, a category and a tag. 
    - Categories and tags are optional, but for this example go ahead and set them. 
* Select the `.Rmd` format for this example. 
* Select <kbd>Done</kbd>

Let's do a quick analysis of the `cars` data set to add some simple content for display. 

* Don't knit this file. Just save. 

_(Instructors note: Intro, summary, pander, sentence, plot, sentence, inline R, hide code)_


### 6. Serve Site

We've been "cheating" a little so far in that our site has already been "Served". 
When we started the new site in step 2, not only did `blogdown` download the theme files and exmaple site, it also ran `blogdown::serve_site()`. This is what allows for the live preview. 

At a later point when you want to come back to working on your website, opening the project file itself will not initiate a `serve_site()`. You will have to do this manually. Again, there is an **Addin** for this. 

### 7. Push to GitHub. 

Go ahead and save your work, add, commit, and push your content to your github account. 


### 8. Hosting / Deploying your website. 

If you have your own server, and you are familiar with website deployment then you can roll your own as you are used to. For those of us that have absolutely no idea how to host a website, a very good option that is very user friendly (and free) is [Netlify](https://www.netlify.com/). 

You *could* use GitHub Pages as we did previously to host a Hugo based website, but there are some tweaks that you have to do to get GitHub to work with/around Jekyll in the way Blogdown/Hugo builds the sites. If you want to learn more about the why's, go read the docs at https://bookdown.org/yihui/blogdown/deployment.html



### Closing comments

* Hugo has a TON of themes: https://themes.gohugo.io/ . Not all work with `blogdown`, and not all are easy to work with. Here is a blog post by Peter Baumgartner on [important thoughts on choosing a theme to work with](https://portfolio.peter-baumgartner.net/2018/07/19/blogdown-using-themes/). 
* The theme shown here has a very simple TOML configuration file. Each theme is different and unique. Reading the documentation (generally contained in the readme) is critical.
