# Housekeeping 

We will not cover ISLR Chapter 3: Linear Regression in much detail, as that is one of the main topics in 456. This however is a **GREAT** chapter to read for a different perspective/approach to regression. `r emo::ji("star")` `r emo::ji("star")``r emo::ji("star")``r emo::ji("star")``r emo::ji("star")`. Highly recommend.

## Learning Tidymodels

Create a new Rmarkdown file and walk through Tidymodels tutorial [Preprocessing your data with recipies](https://www.tidymodels.org/start/recipes/)

Don't just copypasta the tutorial. This is your learning & practice notes file. Write notes to yourself on what you are doing and why.

## Write a Regression tutorial

Leverage your knowledge of linear models and write a tutorial on how to fit a regression model in the Tidy models framework. The data and model you fit is your choice. 

Ref: [ISLR Tidymodels lab for Chapter 3](https://emilhvitfeldt.github.io/ISLR-tidymodels-labs/linear-regression.html). 

Post your tutorial URL in Discord. 

## Peer review
You then are asked to review another classmates tutorial and provide comments & feedback in Discord. Is there something that isn't clear? Did you spot a mistake they can fix? What did you find helpful & useful about their tutorial (be specific). 

Do this as a reply to their tutorial URL post so your replies are easy to find.
