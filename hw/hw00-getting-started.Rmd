## Course Materials

* Familarize yourself with the class website navigation. Make sure you can find
    - The weekly/topic overview grid
    - The due date for this assignment
    - Full list of lecture materials, homework, additional readings
    - Calendar of events, & the toggle between the class calendar and the DSI calendar
    - The project page where all content related to the joint project will be presented. 
  
* Obtain a copy of Doing Data Science (DDS) by O'Neil & Schutt. Through our library there is at least one hard copy available in the Library, and an online version it appears we have free access.
    - Our first reading will be due Tuesday 1/31
* Download a copy of ISLR 7th edition http://faculty.marshall.usc.edu/gareth-james/ISL/ 
    - There are cheap print version avaible. I have no idea what's been updated in each edition aside from corrections.  
* Prepare to obtain a copy of Weapons of Math Destruction (WMD) by Spring Break. There also should be a few copies in the library. 



## Programs

Update R (3.6+) & R Studio (latest)


## Hack MD

We will be using HackMD as a place for collaborative notes. These notes will be locked to our class (using your github user accounts). 

1. Sign in to HackMD using your Github account. Just to make sure it works and you know where to go. We'll use this on Tuesday of week 2. 


## Slack

1. Join our Slack channel csuc-ads.slack.com by clicking on the invite link in your campus email account
2. Download & Install both the phone app, and the desktop app. You must have at least the desktop app at minimum.
3. PM Dr. D with your github username. You will be added to the class organization.  
4. Introduce yourself in the #introductions channel. You'll do something similar in 456, so this is brief. 
    - What do you want to get out of this class?
    - What are you worried/concerned about with this class? (after Tuesday's orientation)


## Twitter

1. Make a Twitter account. When in doubt, link it to your campus email address. 
We'll do more with this later. For now it's yours to connect to the greater DS community. 
2. Add your Twitter handle to the README in the `class-logistics` repo using a pull request.
