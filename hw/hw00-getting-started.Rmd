## Course Materials

* Familarize yourself with the class website navigation. Make sure you can find
    - The weekly/topic overview grid
    - The due date for this assignment
    - Full list of lecture materials, homework, additional readings
    - Calendar of events, & the toggle between the class calendar and the DSI calendar
    - The project page where all content related to the joint project will be presented. 
  
* Obtain a copy of Doing Data Science (DDS) by O'Neil & Schutt. Through our library there is at least one hard copy available in the Library, and an online version it appears we have free access.
    - Our first reading will be due Tuesday 1/31
* Download a copy of ISLR 7th edition http://faculty.marshall.usc.edu/gareth-james/ISL/ 
    - There are cheap print version avaible. I have no idea what's been updated in each edition aside from corrections.  
* Prepare to obtain a copy of Weapons of Math Destruction (WMD) by Spring Break. There also should be a few copies in the library.
