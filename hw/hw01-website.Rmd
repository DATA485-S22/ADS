# Demo Sites

* Create a basic/demo website using both R Markdown and Hugo. 
* These will be checked off in Github Classroom. 

# Start your own site

You can choose to use either method (Rmarkdown/Blogdown). By the due date have the following completed: 

* A page/section with brief info about you
  - Name
  - Contact info
  - Github repo
  - Short Bio (About me)

* A page/section to showcase projects
  - Link to at least one recent project. 
  
* A page/section to blog, write tutorials, share stories. 
  - A "Hello world" example post. 
  
I'm happy to help brainstorm style/formats for Rmarkdown websites. 
Look at all my class websites to see slightly different ways to organize content.
