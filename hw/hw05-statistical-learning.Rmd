# Student Learning Objectives

* Describe the difference between training and testing data sets
* Describe the differnece between a parametric and non-parametric model
* Identify and describe situations where classification, regression, and clustering models are appropriate. 
* Explain the concept of overfitting, and bias-variance tradeoff. 

# Submission Instructions
Prepare answers for the questions you are assigned to. Be concise as you will have to share out/explain it to others. Be prepared to take notes on the remaining questions. Your grade on this portion will be based on completeness. Delete this section before submission. 

Submit your compiled PDF to the corresponding folder in Google Drive by the due date. 



# Part I: In class shared learning. 

[1]
* What is f? 

[2]
* What is the difference between supervised & unsupervised models?
* What is the difference between a parametric & non-parametric model? 


[3]
* What are the advantages of a parametric approach to regression or classification (as opposed to a nonparametric approach)? 
* What are the disadvantages?

[4]
* Why would we ever choose to use a more restrictive method instead of a very flexible approach?

[5]

* What's the difference between training and testing data? Why do we need both? 
* What is overfitting? 
* If we don't have a testing data set, what method can we use to estimate the MSE of the testing data? 

[6]
* What is the bias-variance tradeoff? 

[7]
* What is the primary measure of model fit for regression models? 
* What is the primary measure of model fit for classification models? 
* Name two classification models 

[8]
* Name a benefit of using a KNN model. 
* What happens to the accuracy/bias of the model as the K increases? Why? 




# Part II: Chapter 2 exercises.  

ISLR Ch 2 Exercises: 1, 2, 4 (One example each)


# Part III: Forming a mathematical model to a business question. 

Review the Advertisement data set from ISLR Chapter 2. Figure 2.1 displays sales (in thousands of units) for a particular product as a function of advertising budgets (in thousands of dollars) for TV, radio, and newspaper media.

Suppose that in our role as statistical consultants we are asked to suggest, on the basis of this data, a marketing plan for next year that will result in high product sales. What information would be useful in order to provide such a recommendation?
