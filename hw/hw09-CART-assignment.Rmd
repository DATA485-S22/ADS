# Theory


### Building Regression Trees 

1. What does it mean to _segment_ the data? What do we call this in MATH 456? 
2. Are tree based methods supervised or unsupervised methods? 
3. What does CART stand for? 
4. What determines if a record goes to the left or right of a split? (i.e. what records go left, what go right?) 
5. What do the values in the _internal_ and _terminal_ nodes represent? 
6. How can you tell which variables are most 'important' in a tree model? 
7. What is the _feature space_? Compare this to the term _predictor space_. Do this in your own words. You may want to look into other sources of information (outside the book) for something that fits into your mental model. 
8. Explain how _recursive binary splitting_ works without using equations. 
9. Explain why this process has this name. That is, what about this process is _recursive_? (don't use the word in the definition either), why _binary_?
10. Why its considered _top down_ and _greedy_. 
11. What is a _stopping criterion_? Give an example of one. 
12. Why are decision trees considered a statistical _learning_ model? Where does the algorithmic learning occur? 


### Pruning Trees 

1. How are predictions of new values made? 
2. Why is pruning necessary? Why can't we just build a short tree by stopping early?
3. How is _Cost complexity pruning_ similar to LASSO? 
4. What is the penalty function? Report this in symbols, not words, but define each symbol in words.
5. How is $\alpha$ chosen? 
6. What information do you get out of Figure 8.5? If you were to build this plot as part of your analysis (just the black and green lines), what information can you draw from it? 


## Classification Trees

1. How do you make predictions from a classification tree? 
2. What is the _classification error rate_? 
3. What does _node purity_ mean? Why is it important (it may be helpful to read through the example before answering this question).
4. Is a large or small _Gini index_ preferred? 
5. If prediction accuracy is the goal of tree building, what measure should be used to prune the tree? 

## Advantages and Disadvantages of Trees

1. Name one advantage and disadvantage of trees when compared to classical methods.

# Application

Using your UCI data from the last homework, and using the `caret` package, 

1. Build a decision tree. Prune it. Make a plot. Interpret the results. Calculate test sample accuracy. 
2. Grow a forest. Plot the variable importance. Interpret the results. Calculate test sample accuracy. How does it compare to your models from last homework?
