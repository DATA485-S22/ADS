# Theory

## Introduction and the validation set approach. (ISLR 5.1.1)

1. What are the two most commonly used resampling methods? 
2. The process of evaluating a modelâ€™s performance is known as ____. 
3. The process of selecting the proper level of flexibility for a model is known as _____. 
4. The training error is typically ______ estimates the test error rate. 
5. What is the main reason to use cross-validation? 
6. What is the main reason to use bootstrap? 
7. As the model complexity increases, what happens to the training and testing errors? 
8. Why is the bias low for models with high complexity? 
9. What is a validation set? 
10. Describe the validation process. 
11. What are the drawbacks of the validation set approach? 


## Cross-Validation and LOOCV for Regression and Classification (ISLR 5.1.2- 5.1.5)

1. Describe the process of K-fold cross validation. 
2. _In English_  how do you calculate the cross-validation error rate? 
3. How is LOOCF a special case of CV? 
4. What is a drawback of LOOCF when $n$ is large? 
5. When would we only care about the location of the minimum point in the test MSE curve, and not the actual value of the minimum MSE itself? 
6. Why does k-fold CV give more accurate estimates of the test error rate than LOOCF? Explain this in english. 
7. What is a good value for $k$ that will result in test error rates that find a nice balance between bias and variance? 



## The Bootstrap (ISLR 5.2) [[Video  (11:29)]](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p4BYWX7PTBM&list=PL5-da3qGB5IA6E6ZNXu7dp89_uv8yocmf&index=4)

* The bootstrap is a powerful method for estimating _____? 
* Instead of using the population estimates for the variance and the covariance, what do you use instead? 
* How does creating a bootstrap sample different from creating the sampling distribution? 
* Why do some observations appear more than once in a given bootstrap sample?

# Application

First step, get data. Go to the [UCI Machine Learning repository](http://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets.php) and pick two (2) data sets that you want to work with. Use the links on the left side to filter by the following features: 

* One must be for regression, one must be for classification. You can use the same data set for both if you find one you like. 
* Multivariate data types - No time series, no spatial, no text, no images 
* More than 100 instances (sample size)
* More than 10 attributes (variables) - you have to be able to explain these variables. 
* Preference to non-textbook data sets (i.e. titanic, breast cancer, iris). Consider getting something at least from this century.
