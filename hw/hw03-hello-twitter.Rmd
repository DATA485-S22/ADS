# Part I. Introductions to POLS students (Due Friday 2/7)

Join the POLS Slack channel using this [invitation link](https://join.slack.com/t/pols624-ds-project/shared_invite/enQtODkyMDQ5OTcyMzIxLTBiODEwMjAxNjNhNzg5YzI1NzM4YTkwNGRhYTRhNDQ3MDc1NmFjODRhZjJmYzNlZDUxODhlNmMwNDhmZTlmMmI) that will expire in 4 days.

  - Change your profile picture as well to something recognizable (so youâ€™re not a blank head)
  - Introduce yourself in the #introductions channel
  - Include a pic of yourself with something you like (e.g. animals, basketball, ...soil...). 
  - This helps to "humanize" yourself to the other class. You want them to feel comfortable asking you questions. You are *not* the "data gods" to them. 


# Part II. Readings (Due Monday 2/10)
In our shared Google Drive, there are a selection of documents in the "Twitter project" folder. 

* Pick one of the papers numbered #2 through #5. 
* Post your selection in Slack #readings channel. 
* Two people per paper
* Be prepared to share what data collection, wrangling and analysis was done, and what research question they were trying to understand.  
    
# Part III. Twitter Tutorial for POLS (Due Fri 2/14)

Work in teams of 2 to write a (rmarkdown) tutorial for the POLS students to get current (past 30 days) Twitter data for some using `rtweet` (no Twitter account is needed) and your choice of topic hashtag. 

* Demonstrate how to look at data
* Go through each variable and show how to examine/think about it
    - what is the data type? 
* Show an example of how to use the data for each relevant column E.g. 
    - we don't care about an ID
    - timestamp can get converted into a date, aggregate counts of tweets per day can be plotted over time, 
    - Use simple `grep` pattern matching (not regex) to extract a keyword or two into a new variable. (e.g. indicator of the word 'frightening')

Do not try to rehash an analysis that you read in one of the manuscripts, unless it's _really_ easy. 

### Submission
* I will work on figuring this out this/next week. 
* Comment/PR other team's tutorial using issues. - connected to first bullet point.
* After revision, post this as a blog post/project post on your website. 

# Part IV. Documentation for getting historical tweets (Due 2/14)
Work together as a class in Hack MD to write a clear and concise tutorial on how to get historical twitter data into R. 

I will give this to someone else who is familiar with R, but not Twitter data to test drive your explanation. I advise taking turns to follow the instructions yourself to see what's missing / what can be re-worded. 

This is part of being able to explain yourself to others.
