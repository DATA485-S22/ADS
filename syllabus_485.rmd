# Who are we learning it with? 

My name is Robin Donatello and my pronouns are she/her. You can address me as "Robin", "Dr. D", or some other respectful title such as "professor". 

I have a Doctorate in Public Health (DrPH) Biostatistics from UCLA, but I'm a Chico alum. I double majored in Statistics &  Biology, with minor in Chemistry, and a first generation college student who started at Butte College. 
My campus life consists of training the next generation of Scientists how to harness the power of Statistics and Data in a responsible and ethical manner, supporting students in their academic adventures through intensive advising and research, leading the Data Science Initiative (DSI) to develop Data Science capacity on our campus, and providing analytical support and statistical consulting for many projects on and off campus.

When I‚Äôm not on campus, typically I‚Äôm growing ü•ïüåæüçÖüçÜüçè for my family, out adventuring with my üê∂üßîüê©, or getting some üéÆüé≤üìö time in.

You can learn more about the work that I do on my [website](http://www.norcalbiostat.com/)

# Interdisciplinary Collaboration Project

We will be collaborating with two campus organizations to provide data and research assistance. Details about the projects will be discussed in class and posted on the course website.

# How is learning measured? (What are you graded on?)

There are five general areas that each piece of work will fall under. 

* Skills: Can you do the thing? 
* Communication: Can you talk about the thing? 
* Knowledge: Do you understand the thing? 
* Collaboration: Can you work on the thing with someone else? 
* Learning: What did you learn from engaging with the thing? 

Each week you will have several tasks to work through. Each task will have a % effort for the week. I will review your work and grade on the completion of each task. You will then be given a score (out of 10) for the week calculated as `completion status * % effort`. 


## Grading

- Your grades will be available in a private github repo that is updated on a regular basis. 
- I mostly stick with the standard grade cutoff ranges of 100-90%: A, 89-80%: B, 79-70%: C, 69-60%: D, 0-59%: F, but reserve the right to modify those ranges depending on how I feel the semester went.
- I also reserve the right to round a grade up up if borderline (i.e. 89.6% to a 90%) based on in-class attitude and general engagement in the class. 

There will be one extra credit opportunity: [DataFest](https://chicodatafest.netlify.app/)

# Class Policies and statements

## Everyone is welcome here

It is my intent that students from all diverse backgrounds and perspectives be well-served by this course, that students' learning needs be addressed both in and out of class, and that the diversity that the students bring to this class be viewed as a resource, strength and benefit. It is my intent to present materials and activities that are respectful of diversity: gender identity, sexuality, disability, age, socioeconomic status, ethnicity, race, nationality, religion, and culture. Your suggestions are encouraged and appreciated. Please let me know ways to improve the effectiveness of the course for you personally, or for other students or student groups.

I would like to create a learning environment that supports a diversity of thoughts, perspectives and experiences, and honors your identities (including race, gender, class, sexuality, religion, ability, etc.) To help accomplish this:

-  Let me know if you have a name and/or set of pronouns that differ from those that appear in your official Chico records. I make it a point to call on people by name, so please make sure that I know what you want to be called. 
        - I also want to try to pronounce your name as accurately as possible. The more you help and correct me the better I can do to honor your name. 
-   If you feel like your performance in the class is being impacted by your experiences outside of class, please don't hesitate to come and talk with me. I want to be a resource for you. Remember that you can also submit anonymous feedback using the feedback button on the schedule and help pages of the website (which will lead to me making a general announcement to the class, if necessary to address your concerns).
-   If you prefer to speak with someone outside of the course, the Office of Diversity and Inclusion is here to assist. Their number is 530-898-4764, and email [diversityoffice\@csuchico.edu](mailto:diversityoffice@csuchico.edu){.email}
-   I (like many people) am still in the process of learning about diverse perspectives and identities. If something was said in class (by anyone) that made you feel uncomfortable, please talk to me about it. (Again, anonymous feedback is always an option).

*Adapted from [Monica Linden at Brown University](https://www.brown.edu/sheridan/teaching-learning-resources/inclusive-teaching/statements)*.

Furthermore, I would like to acknowledge that Chico State stands on lands that were originally occupied by the first people of this area, the Mechoopda. I recognize their distinctive spiritual relationship with this land and the waters that run through campus. I am humbled that our campus resides upon sacred lands that once sustained the Mechoopda people for centuries.


## Attendance

This is a fully in person class, however time has shown us that we need to be flexible and be able to go online at anytime. There may be times we want/need to hold/attend class remotely.  

Class attendance is expected. Talk to me ahead of time if you need to miss a class for a planned reason. In the event of an unplanned reason, PM me in Discord when you can so that I know you are still alive. 

* If you are not feeling well or are experiencing Covid symptoms **DO NOT COME TO CLASS**. DM me in Discord and attend online until you can return. 
    - This is NOT an open invitation to attend class online just because it's cold and rainy or you are hungover and didn't get up until 20 minutes before class. Don't abuse my flexibility. 

## Zoom Eqituette

When we meet online please attend to the following

-   **Location**: I don't really care where you're at, as long as you're not lying down and falling asleep.
-   **Camera**: On is my preference as it helps to foster connections. I acknowledge that personal/bandwidth limitations do exist and there may be times where you need to turn off the camera. It is recommended that you use a blurred or virtual background as needed for privacy. 
-   **Microphone**: Keep yourself muted unless sharing out as a way to keep background noise to a minimum.
-   **Food/drink**: No problem. Just no see-food.
-   **Kids/Pets**: Yes please! Pet visits are especially encouraged, but we must get introductions.

# University Policies

## COVID-19 

The CSU requires students to be fully vaccinated and boosted against COVID-19 by February 28th, 2022, unless you have an approved exemption.  Additionally, Chico State is requiring everyone on campus to wear an approved face covering in all indoor campus spaces. Accordingly, all students are required to wear an appropriate face mask covering the nose and mouth in order to participate in this course. Policies and requirements regarding COVID-19 are subject to change pursuant to campus, local, state and/or federal guidelines.

Please note that dishonesty relating to the vaccination policy and/or your failure to comply with any other COVID-19 related safety policy or mandate, including the face covering requirement, may result in disciplinary action against you through the office of Student Conduct, Rights and Responsibilities, which can include suspension or expulsion from the California State University system. 

Individuals unable to wear a face covering due to a medical condition should contact the Accessibility Resource Center by phone at (530) 898-5959 or by email at arcdept@csuchico.edu. 


## Adding and Dropping the course

You are responsible for understanding the policies and procedures about add/drops, academic renewal, etc., found in the [CSU Chico University Catalog](http://www.csuchico.edu/catalog/). You should be aware of the new deadlines and penalties for adding and dropping classes.

## Academic Integrity

Academic integrity is defined as ‚Äúa commitment, even in the face of adversity, to five fundamental values: honesty, trust, fairness, respect, and responsibility‚Äù. From these values flow principles of behavior that enable academic communities to translate ideals to action. Academic integrity is expected and required. No forms of cheating or plagiarism will be tolerated. Please see your student handbook at https://www.csuchico.edu/scrr/integrity.shtml if you have questions about the meaning of these terms or the consequences of violating academic integrity.
