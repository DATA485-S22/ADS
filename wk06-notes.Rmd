# Housekeeping 

* Website organization update. Added materials page. 
* Start to bring headphones to class. You'll be watching short videos & taking notes during class. 
* ISLR Logistics
  - We will use a single ISLR repo for all work. I will add files to it regularly and review your work using the feedback branch. **Don't merge this branch**. Push and pull regularly. 
  - Before class: Watch videos and prepare answers to selected questions
  - During class: Discuss and compare answers to questions with classmates, sometimes will watch additional videos and share out. 
  - After class
      - Finish answering any remaining questions 
      - Complete any practice problems and/or activities assigned 
* Project Logistics
  - Weekly wednesday updates to the project page on the ADS website. 
  - First (10 min) project report out on Thursday the 10th. Then every 2 weeks. Present overhead to class and possibly client via Zoom.
* Reading logistics
  - Reading discussion every other week
  - Learning journal updates on off weeks.

# Learning Path

### Where we've been

* Getting orientated with the semester long project
* Practicing data wrangling and report writing for a professional audience.

### Where we're at

* Learning how to balance textbook learning and project based learning while keeping the broader ethical implications in mind. 
* If you didn't have an organization schedule for your classes yet, you should do so asap. The workload in this class is going to ramp up a bit. 

### Where we're going

* Digging into mathematical models of statistical learning.
* Learning new R code methods, practicing building models. 

### Learning Objectives

* Describe the difference between training and testing data sets
* Describe the difference between a parametric and non-parametric model
* Identify and describe situations where classification, regression, and clustering models are appropriate. 
* Explain the concept of overfitting, and bias-variance tradeoff.

# Tuesday

## Prepare

* Clone your ISLR Repo.
* Watch or read ISLR Ch 1 on your own before class. [[Full playlist]](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLAOUn-KLSAVOPE3yQ04EZCbt0ycTib6OH)
  - [Opening Remarks and Examples](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5N9V07EIfIg&list=PL5-da3qGB5ICcUhueCyu25slvsGp8IDTa&index=1) (18:18)
  - [Supervised and Unsupervised Learning](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z0v9QMkA3dA&list=PL5-da3qGB5ICcUhueCyu25slvsGp8IDTa&index=2) (12:12)
* Start to work through ISLR Chapter 2. [[Full YouTube video playlist]](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p9n2w236B48&list=PLAOUn-KLSAVOwBuphhdi-BT0jjhuWyvPL)

`r emo::ji("busts_in_silhouette")` Discuss these questions in your group and write the answers in the `ch2-statistical-learning.Rmd` file in your ISRL repo. You may not finish all questions in the time allotted during class, you will have to finish outside of class. 

### [Statistical Learning and Regression](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p9n2w236B48&list=PL5-da3qGB5IDvuFPNoSqheihPOQNJpzyy&index=1) (11:41)

1. What is f? 
2. Why do we care about estimating f? 
3. Describe the two types of errors in a model.  
4. What concept in 456 does irreducible error portion of the model correspond to? 


### [Curse of Dimensionality and Parametric Models](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HndOzII4jzs&list=PL5-da3qGB5IDvuFPNoSqheihPOQNJpzyy&index=2) (11:40)

1. Summarize the curse of dimensionality.
2. What is the difference between a parametric & non-parametric model? Give an example of each. 
3. What are the advantages & disadvantages of a parametric approach to regression or classification (as opposed to a nonparametric approach)?
4. Why would we ever choose to use a more restrictive method instead of a very flexible approach?
5. What is the difference between supervised & unsupervised learning? Give an example of each.

# Thursday

## Prepare

* Finish ISLR Chapter 2
* Open project work time


### [Assessing Model Accuracy and Bias-Variance Trade-off](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VaN1RUDuioQ&list=PL5-da3qGB5IDvuFPNoSqheihPOQNJpzyy&index=3) (10:04)

1. What is the primary measure of model accuracy for regression models? 
2. Compare and contrast a _smoothing spline_ to a _linear regression line_. (What is the same, what is different) 
3. What's the difference between training and testing data? Why do we need both? 
4. What is overfitting? 
5. If we don't have a testing data set, what method can we use to estimate the MSE of the testing data?
6. What is the bias-variance trade-off? 

### [Classification Problems and K-Nearest Neighbors](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TnVRhLqThR4&list=PL5-da3qGB5IDvuFPNoSqheihPOQNJpzyy&index=4) (15:37)

1. What is the primary measure of model accuracy for classification models? 
2. Describe the Bayes Classifier 
3. What is the Bayes error rate? 
4. What is a limitation of the Bayes classifier? 
5. Describe how the K-Nearest Neighbors classifier works. 
6. Name a benefit of using a KNN model. 
7. What happens to the accuracy/bias of the model as the K increases? Why?
