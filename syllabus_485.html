<div id="who-are-we-learning-it-with" class="section level1">
<h1>Who are we learning it with?</h1>
<p>My name is Robin Donatello and my pronouns are she/her. You can address me as “Robin”, “Dr. D”, or some other respectful title such as “professor”.</p>
<p>I am a first generation college student who started at Butte College, double majored in Statistics &amp; Biology, with minor in Chemistry here at Chico State, and ended with a Doctorate in Public Health (DrPH) Biostatistics from UCLA.</p>
<p>My campus life consists of training the next generation of Scientists how to harness the power of Statistics and Data in a responsible and ethical manner, supporting students in their academic adventures through intensive advising and research, leading the Data Science Initiative (DSI) to develop Data Science capacity on our campus, and providing analytical support and statistical consulting for many projects on and off campus.</p>
<p>When I’m not on campus, typically I’m growing 🥕🌾🍅🍆🍏 for my family, out adventuring with my 🐶🧔🐩, or getting some 🎮🎲📚 time in.</p>
<p>You can learn more about the work that I do on my <a href="http://www.norcalbiostat.com/">website</a></p>
<hr />
</div>
<div id="how-are-we-learning-it" class="section level1">
<h1>How are we learning it?</h1>
<ul>
<li><strong>Traditional coursework</strong> We will be working through ISLR to learn and practice predictive modeling using typical problem sets.</li>
<li><strong>Collaborative note taking</strong> Students will collaborate to generate class-wide course notes and materials.</li>
<li><strong>Reading &amp; Reflecting</strong> We will engage with several readings where you will be asked to answer reflection questions in your personal learning journal, as well as having discussions with your peers.</li>
<li><strong>Peer feedback / code review</strong> Reviewing each others work and code facilitates the sharing of knowledge, strengthens your ability to read others work, and can find bugs and problems early in the development stage.</li>
<li><strong>Interdisciplinary Collaboration Project</strong> We will be collaborating with two campus organizations to provide data and research assistance. Details about the projects will be discussed in class and posted on the course website.</li>
</ul>
<hr />
</div>
<div id="how-is-learning-measured" class="section level1">
<h1>How is learning measured?</h1>
<p>The learning objectives for this class are very broad and high level. To work towards achieving those goals you will have several tasks to work through each week. Depending on the effort level for each task, the actual number of tasks will vary.</p>
<p>There are five general areas that each task is designed to help strengthen.</p>
<ul>
<li>Skills: Can you do the thing?</li>
<li>Communication: Can you talk about the thing?</li>
<li>Knowledge: Do you understand the thing?</li>
<li>Collaboration: Can you work on the thing with someone else?</li>
<li>Learning: What did you learn from engaging with the thing?</li>
</ul>
<p>I will review your work and provide feedback as appropriate. To acknowledge that revision and growth is part of every aspect of our lives, that we all are balancing other external priorities and that nothing is ever perfect, I use an effort based scoring method.</p>
<p>Each task will be classified as incomplete (0) / needs major revision (0.5) / complete (1). You will then be given a score for the week calculated as <code>completion status * % effort</code> summed over all tasks. Scores will be scaled to 10 points for ease of addition.</p>
<div id="grading" class="section level2">
<h2>Grading</h2>
<ul>
<li>A dataset of tasks with completion status, % effort and a script that generates your weekly and overall scores will be available in a private github repo that is updated regularly.</li>
<li>I mostly stick with the standard grade cutoff ranges of 100-90%: A, 89-80%: B, 79-70%: C, 69-60%: D, 0-59%: F, but reserve the right to modify those ranges depending on how I feel the semester went.</li>
<li>I also reserve the right to round a grade up up if borderline (i.e. 89.6% to a 90%) based on in-class attitude and general engagement in the class.</li>
</ul>
<p>There will be one extra credit opportunity: <a href="https://chicodatafest.netlify.app/">DataFest</a></p>

<h1>Class Policies and statements</h1>
<div id="everyone-is-welcome-here" class="section level2">
<h2>Everyone is welcome here</h2>
<p>It is my intent that students from all diverse backgrounds and perspectives be well-served by this course, that students’ learning needs be addressed both in and out of class, and that the diversity that the students bring to this class be viewed as a resource, strength and benefit. It is my intent to present materials and activities that are respectful of diversity: gender identity, sexuality, disability, age, socioeconomic status, ethnicity, race, nationality, religion, and culture. Your suggestions are encouraged and appreciated. Please let me know ways to improve the effectiveness of the course for you personally, or for other students or student groups.</p>
<p>I would like to create a learning environment that supports a diversity of thoughts, perspectives and experiences, and honors your identities (including race, gender, class, sexuality, religion, ability, etc.) To help accomplish this:</p>
<ul>
<li>Let me know if you have a name and/or set of pronouns that differ from those that appear in your official Chico records. I make it a point to call on people by name, so please make sure that I know what you want to be called. - I also want to try to pronounce your name as accurately as possible. The more you help and correct me the better I can do to honor your name.</li>
<li>If you feel like your performance in the class is being impacted by your experiences outside of class, please don’t hesitate to come and talk with me. I want to be a resource for you. Remember that you can also submit anonymous feedback using the feedback button on the schedule and help pages of the website (which will lead to me making a general announcement to the class, if necessary to address your concerns).</li>
<li>If you prefer to speak with someone outside of the course, the Office of Diversity and Inclusion is here to assist. Their number is 530-898-4764, and email <a href="mailto:diversityoffice@csuchico.edu" class="email">diversityoffice@csuchico.edu</a></li>
<li>I (like many people) am still in the process of learning about diverse perspectives and identities. If something was said in class (by anyone) that made you feel uncomfortable, please talk to me about it. (Again, anonymous feedback is always an option).</li>
</ul>
<p><em>Adapted from <a href="https://www.brown.edu/sheridan/teaching-learning-resources/inclusive-teaching/statements">Monica Linden at Brown University</a></em>.</p>
<p>Furthermore, I would like to acknowledge that Chico State stands on lands that were originally occupied by the first people of this area, the Mechoopda. I recognize their distinctive spiritual relationship with this land and the waters that run through campus. I am humbled that our campus resides upon sacred lands that once sustained the Mechoopda people for centuries.</p>

<div id="attendance" class="section level2">
<h2>Attendance</h2>
<p>This is a fully in person class, however time has shown us that we need to be flexible and be able to go online at anytime. There may be times we want/need to hold/attend class remotely.</p>
<p>Class attendance is expected. Talk to me ahead of time if you need to miss a class for a planned reason. In the event of an unplanned reason, PM me in Discord when you can so that I know you are still alive.</p>
<ul>
<li>If you are not feeling well or are experiencing Covid symptoms <strong>DO NOT COME TO CLASS</strong>. DM me in Discord and attend online until you can return.
<ul>
<li>This is NOT an open invitation to attend class online just because it’s cold and rainy or you are hungover and didn’t get up until 20 minutes before class. Don’t abuse my flexibility.</li>
</ul></li>
</ul>
</div>
<div id="zoom-eqituette" class="section level2">
<h2>Zoom Eqituette</h2>
<p>When we meet online please attend to the following</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Location</strong>: I don’t really care where you’re at, as long as you’re not lying down and falling asleep.</li>
<li><strong>Camera</strong>: On is my preference as it helps to foster connections. I acknowledge that personal/bandwidth limitations do exist and there may be times where you need to turn off the camera. It is recommended that you use a blurred or virtual background as needed for privacy.</li>
<li><strong>Microphone</strong>: Keep yourself muted unless sharing out as a way to keep background noise to a minimum.</li>
<li><strong>Food/drink</strong>: No problem. Just no see-food.</li>
<li><strong>Kids/Pets</strong>: Yes please! Pet visits are especially encouraged, but we must get introductions.</li>

<div id="academic-integrity" class="section level2">
<h2>Academic Integrity</h2>
<p>Academic integrity is defined as “a commitment, even in the face of adversity, to five fundamental values: honesty, trust, fairness, respect, and responsibility”. From these values flow principles of behavior that enable academic communities to translate ideals to action. Academic integrity is expected and required. No forms of cheating or plagiarism will be tolerated. Please see your student handbook at <a href="https://www.csuchico.edu/scrr/integrity.shtml" class="uri">https://www.csuchico.edu/scrr/integrity.shtml</a> if you have questions about the meaning of these terms or the consequences of violating academic integrity.</p>
