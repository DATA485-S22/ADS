# Summary

It is the top mission of the university to retain and graduate students who are well prepared for careers or graduate school. There has been a major shift in the student body with regards to demographics and preparation in the past 10 or so years. Now more than ever the faces and experiences of the faculty do not match that of their students. Chico State has been struggling with a low 4-year graduation rate, and a high first year drop out rate for first time freshmen. Large CSU system wide initiatives such as the Graduation Initiative 2025 (GI2025) have been formed to research what works and implement innovative changes to remove barriers that impede student success and be more strategic about the way campus serves students.

One approach being taken by Chico State is to implement a student learning program called Supplemental Instruction (SI). This program that has shown to be effective in published research but has yet to be evaluated on our campus.

# Project Goals

Assist the clients in answering the following question:

> What impact does Supplemental Instruction have on student success at Chico State?

This question will be explored through the full data science lifecycle from problem definition, data collection and exploration, visualization, modeling (both for understand relationships and to make predictions), creating recommendations and incorporating feedback.

## Completed
* The client will give a 15-20 minute project introduction at 9:30am on 2/10 in Butte 203
* The Data Science Student Team (DSST) will complete Data Security and CITI training by 2/18/22
* DSST will research the problem and generate a list of data sources needed to address the question.
* Read/Summarize exact matching paper and 5-10 most recent works. Complete by March 10th.
* Clean Student Profile, Student Program and Course Description data sets. Update code books. 
* Acquire SI data set.
* Created grades for SI courses, clean student profile data, and filtered student profile data to students who have taken at least one SI course for EDA. 
* Aggregate the course level data (Doesn't seem to be a fruitful approach. On hold for now). 
* Look at number of extra semesters taken to graduate. Add additional variables (Transfer student, first gen, major program.) Need to address how to handle pandemic/online semesters here. Pandemic seems to limit this approach.
* Select a poster template by 03/27/2022.

## In Progress
* Examine a basic model of the form grades ~ attended SI at least once. 
* Explorartion of CEM with S.I as a treatment and grade as outcome.
* Logistic Regression model using different equity gaps to model probability of one year retention. 
* Prepare/Contact Eric for share out on 04/05/2022.

## Long term goals.
* The faculty supervisor will work with Institutional Research (IR) to obtain available data for student use. The faculty supervisor is responsible for ensuring the privacy and responsible use of the data.
* 10-15 minute project check ins during class time approximately every two weeks starting 3/10/2022. The DSST will provide updates to the client on their progress with opportunity to ask questions from both parties.
* The client will review a scientific poster created by the DSST for presentation at the College of Natural Sciences Poster Session, on May 2nd.  
* The DSST will give a final stakeholder presentation to the GI Inqury members/leadership during the week of May 15th, 2022 (Finals week).

# Project Updates
_Weekly updates done by DSST via PR_

## 02/21/2022

Today, we met for the first time. Roles were assigned, and we discussed what our first steps will be.

* Next Steps:

  1. Complete security training.
  2. Download data.
  3. Start exploring and building a codebook.

* Remarks: 

  - Keep separate scratch files.
  - PR will be flexible.
  - Respond on discord by end of day.
  - Add data sets to gitignore file before commiting. 
  

## 3/01/2022

* Milestones 
 - Data codebooks complete
 - Started reviewing literature 
 
* Next steps 
 - Exploratory data analysis 
 - Discuss literature as group 
 - Literature summary

## 03/10/2022

* Met with Erik to discuss first steps.

  - Still waiting on SI visit data.
  - Look at Fresno State paper by Hongtao Yue et al.
  - Look into clinical trial methodologies for techniques. 
  - Explore GPA data and quantify some of the equity gaps.
  - Data Still needed:
  
    - SI visit level data
    - Student date (or) year of birth
    - Flag if student is Pell eligible (Probably can't get)
    - Flag if student participated in upward bound
    - Flag if student lived in residence hall
    - Flag if student is enrolled in honors program
    - Flag if student is enrolled in EOP
    - Student permanent address zip (or) county
