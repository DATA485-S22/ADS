**Curation vs Creation**

> Don't stress out! You're not creating new content to share, you're curating (or sharing) existing knowledge to new sources.

### Making your own website/blog

```{r}
kable(topic2) %>% kable_styling(bootstrap_options = c("striped","condensed"))
```

Here are some examples that use varying customizations of this approach. That means you can look at the authors github repo and see how they designed their site features. This is how we learn how to do cool things!

### But the internet is scary & I value my privacy
Which is a really really good thing as we'll talk more about how your data can be used against you later. But here are some readings that aim to convince you that it's a really good habit that starting early can only make you look more awesome later on when you start really marketing yourself.
