:question: When was Data Science at the top of the Hype cycle? 
* [Derek Borders] 2012-2014.  
Around 2014 there was a lot of noise made about DS being the 'Sexiest Career of the 21st Century'[forbes-2014]https://www.forbes.com/sites/sap/2014/01/21/data-scientist-sexiest-job-of-the-century/), [Harvard Business Review, 2012](https://hbr.org/2012/10/data-scientist-the-sexiest-job-of-the-21st-century)
* I graduated high school in 2018, that's when I first heard about it being the most hired or "hot" job. Though, the movie "Moneyball", based on the 2003 Oakland A's season, incorporated data science into the game of baseball.
* When big data became profitable. 
* Around the early to mid 2010s following realizing how profitable big data and datamining was. With all the reasearch facebook and google was doing with the data in the realms of AI and machine learning furthered the hype as most people didn't understand it and have watched alot of movies.
* It probably peaked around early to mid 2010s.
* I think it was a Hype when companies starte to see the value of Ai and Machine learning practices for profit.
* It feels like data science was at the top of the Hype Cycle around the early 2010s.
* It is in its hype now knowing the demand for data scientist is so high. Since its demand is high, more opportunities for a high paying job because people like money
* In 2012 Davenport and Patil coined Data Science the Sexiest proffesion in the 21st century.
* 2019 
* early 2000s academic journalls began to recognize data science as a field (https://datasciencedegree.wisconsin.edu/blog/history-of-data-science/)


:busts_in_silhouette: Give an example of _datafication_ that affects you personaly. 

* [Faith] Ease of finding things via personal adds
* [Skip] Recieve more personal adds through social media. It is easier to research with online publications. 
* [Ethan] Seeing how personalized advertisement had become when I felt like I was relatively careful about the data I was giving out publicly.
* [Rica] Having my data shared on the internet showed me perzonalized ads and articles to get me to click on things that I am interested in
* [Joseph] Before I stopped using Facebook, my feed began to fill up with posts that the algorithm thought I would like. However, I was only interested in posts directly from my friends and family.
* [Thomas] Once facebook started personalizing algorithms based on data collection. 
* [Matthew] Personalized ads for products based on my search history and likes on social media posts, it affected me by feeding me items to buy in which I have done a lot. A lot of the time I liked the posts they have recommended.
* [Brandon] Social media has used targeted advertisments linked across many different platforms based on data they collect from me.
* [Joshua] Started seeing ads based on what I was searching for, on how it affected me,it made me a little paranoid.
* [Derek B.] Recommendation systems have essentially replaced any need I ever had for advertising. Targeted ads have saved me countless hours of watching tampon and Viagra commercials. 
* [Derek H.] Ads targeted towards things I search for once



# What is a Data Scientist? 

:busts_in_silhouette: Find an answer to the question "What is a Data Scientist" for each year prior to now. Let's see how far back we can go in a reasonable amount of time. Include the URL of your finding as a link. 

* 2021: [Faith] 
"Today, successful data professionals understand that they must advance past the traditional skills of analyzing large amounts of data, data mining, and programming skills."-[Berkeley](https://ischoolonline.berkeley.edu/data-science/what-is-data-science/)(2021)
"The term “data scientist” was coined as recently as 2008 when companies realized the need for data professionals who are skilled in organizing and analyzing massive amounts of data." -[Berkeley](https://ischoolonline.berkeley.edu/data-science/what-is-data-science/)(2021)

* 2020: [Skip] "Data science combines the scientific method, math and statistics, specialized programming, advanced analytics, AI, and even storytelling to uncover and explain the business insights buried in data." (https://www.ibm.com/cloud/learn/data-science-introduction)

* 2019: [Ethan] "According to the article, the demographics of data scientist in 2019 was 69% male, 74% with a masters/phd. In 2019, the 3 most valuable tools according to data scientist were python, r, and sql and the biggest employer is the technology/it field."
https://www.kdnuggets.com/2019/03/typical-data-scientist-2019.html

* 2018: [Rica] "First, data scientists lay a solid data foundation in order to perform robust analytics" https://hbr.org/2018/08/what-data-scientists-really-do-according-to-35-data-scientists

He/she masters a whole range of skills and talents going from being able to handle the raw data, analyzing that data with the help of statistical techniques, to sharing his/her insights with his peers in a compelling way. " https://www.kdnuggets.com/2015/11/different-data-science-roles-industry.html

* 2014: [Brandon] "This year we will also see the role of the data scientist become more specialized. Companies will invest in data science teams rather than data scientist individuals, with the team having people with IT, statistics, and business experience..." https://analyticsindiamag.com/the-data-scientist-in-2014/

* 2013: [Joshua] "the "data" part of data science, is increasingly heterogeneous and unstructuredtext, images, videooften emanating from networks with complex relationships between their entities." https://cacm.acm.org/magazines/2013/12/169933-data-science-and-prediction/fulltext

* 2012: [Derek B.]  
> A data scientist is a rare hybrid, a computer scientist with the programming abilities to build software to scrape, combine, and manage data from a variety of sources and a statistican who knows how to derive insights from the information within.  
> -Mar 2, 2012  
> [Guardian](https://www.theguardian.com/news/datablog/2012/mar/02/data-scientist#:~:text=A%20data%20scientist%20is%20a,insights%20from%20the%20information%20within.)

:question: How has the idea or definition of a data scientist changed over the years? 

* "Because all of science itself will soon become data that can be mined, the imminent revolution in data science is not about mere “scaling up,” but instead the emergence of scientific studies of data analysis science-wide." [50 Years of Data Science, 2017; Donoho, David](https://doi.org/10.1080/10618600.2017.1384734). What was once simply the study of statistics evolved into the domain of data scinece.

* It changed from thinking data science is a mixture of a computer scientist and statistician to a variety skill sets that have been evolved with people coming from different backgrounds and expertise

* Now there is so much data collected, the field is more focused on implementing models. 

* At first in the earlier years the definition of a data science seemed kinda ambigious, it seemed that people didn't really know except that it involves data of some kind. As the years progressed the definition became more clear: computer science, linguistics, econometrics, sociology, and other disciplines, data science is involved in all of these.

* The definition of the role has change from a very broad role that encompasses a large array of tools and skills across statistics and computer science to a role that has now become more specialized to for each part of the data science sub-fields and down to more specified idustries.

* I think that throughout the years it started in the more Statistics field, with some programming expertise, then throughout the years (maybe very quickly) the field adopted more computer science teachiniques to help streamline the analysis of big data through ML and AI and then blended with many more fields.

* I think there is maybe a stronger understanding of the tools used in data science, but the definition still seems to rely on citing the tools used.






* It feels like the definition has gotten broader and less rigoous over the years. Early on, a data scientist was a triple expert in different, but overlapping fields. Now a lot of people with only one of the three things can be part of a data science team and confidently put 'data scientist' on their resume.
* Beyond the definition, the practice has become easier as tooling improves. A decade ago, data scientist had to engineer most of their own tools, but now we have an ever expanding landscape of accessible libraries and frameworks that can be used off the shelf or modified slightly for specialized use cases.

* It seems over the course of history Data Science evolved to become more art than science. It seems like the original hope of data science was to extract truths, but now it is more about painting a narrative that is agreeable. The biggest changes, I think, are in the tools that data science uses. The rise of data science goes hand in hand with the rise in technology. More powerful tools led to more robust techniques. Also, commercialization changed the kinds of data sets we worked on.

* Data science seems like it used to be aimed towards statisticians, but now if you read job descriptions they want people from all types of academic backgrounds: business, CS, math, physical sciences, etc. 

* Over the years, it feels like definition of a data sciencist has become more focused on working in teams and bringing together people from different academic backgrounds


:question:  What are the commonalities? 

* Applications of statistical methods in order to understand patterns within data.

* I beleive the goal and application of the stats still stay the same. The Scientists want to make these educated predictions, decisions, etc with the help of solid statistical method. 

* Able to use different methods of statisitcs and analytics with data that is given.

* Math, stats, programming, thinking ethically to help better the world

* still talking about the tools 

* Data science is still about analytics and extracting meaningful information from data. It's still a hybrid discipline, even if the standards for how good a person must be at both things have relaxed substantially.

* The strategy of cleaning data, exploring, hypothesize, and repeat has remained. 

* Statistics is still the core of data science

* Historically, statisticians and the term 'statistics' were coined at the beginning of modern efforts to compile census data. Census data is roughly the scale of big data, yet statisticians are often associated with making inferences from small samples.

* Collecting data.

# How do I get started? 
No two paths are the same, but you're already very much on your way. Lifelong learning is the key, as is the desire to sit and tinker with things. 

Following people/news on Social media/blogs is also a great way to keep up with current news and topics, and to learn about new things. 

As you get closer to graduating (next year?), and thinking about those next steps, start googling topics like _"How to become a Data Scientist"_, and _"Data Science skillset"_. (Make sure you filter to show articles in the past year.)

Here are a few articles that stood out to me
* https://towardsdatascience.com/compilation-of-advice-for-new-and-aspiring-data-scientists-5ea75a3925c4
* https://www.tableau.com/learn/articles/data-science-skills
* https://insights.dice.com/2019/11/20/how-to-become-a-data-scientist/


:exclamation: remember... these articles are someone's opinion from their perspective, in their sector.

You are not going to meet _all_ criteria, you are not a unicorn, but you are a beautiful and unique scientist. :muscle: Your DS profile will change, it will grow as you learn new things. Your path will be unique depending on your skillset and desires. 

Of course there are a common set of skills and knowledges that you need, and thats what this DS Certificate aims to provide you with at least the start of. 

:busts_in_silhouette:  But what are *you* going to do? What's your path to stardom? -- In your learning journal

* List 3 topics not covered in our class that you would like to learn.
* List 2 actions that you will engage in to learn those topics.
* List 1 habit you will try to build to aid your journey.
