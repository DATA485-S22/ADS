# Course Logistics

An introduction video was posted in Blackboard going over the syllabus and all the important logistics of the class. 

> Introductions

You know a bit about me from the video. I want to get to know you. 
- Where are you from
- Why are you interested in data science? 
- What do you want to do when you graduate? 

**To post later in Discord**
- What is one thing you want us to know about you?
- Do you have any pets, or favorite items?  (pictures!)

# Course Description

This course aims to help students navigate the evolving field of Data Science. We do so by not only providing training in advanced programming and technical skills, but also by providing opportunities for collaboration and reflection on how Data Science impacts human society. The overarching themes of the class include the following. 

### Collaboration
* Team collaboration tools (Discord, Zoom, Github, HackMD)
* Community Coding - hold helper hours X times /week
* [DATAFEST](chicodatafest.netlify.com)!! April 1-3rd. (Extra credit!)
* What's your Data Science Profile?

### Computation 
* Identifying and applying appropriate methods to answer a business or research need. 
* Introduction to Statistical learning / Machine learning techniques

### Communication 
* Effectively communicating your results is necessary for adoption and further development. 
* Dissemination of reproducible, transparent research.
    - Present at the College of Natural Science Poster Session
* Writing instructional materials/documentation/tutorials for others to learn things.  
* Reflections and discussion on readings, interesting findings
* Peer review

### Community 
* Building a professional online presence
* Social Media for #DataScientists 
* Who's out there doing cool things? 
* Keeping current with a fast moving field. What's next on the Hype Cycle?

### Conscience 
* Ethics of predictive analytics, artificial intelligence 
* Protecting privacy in the age of open data
* Playing with the emotions of the electorate / Facebook 2016 / Election 2020?
* Role of Tech in controlling/spreading fake news

### Career
* Cos we gotta make munny!
* What are your options? 
* Money, Location, Satisfaction --> Can we get all 3? 

### Continuing Education
* There is no way we can cover everything there is to Data Science in 1 (or 2) classes. 
* You have to find things that you want to work on. 
* Start building your own library of resources
* Increasing your Google-fu

_Important: A measure of patience with me is required._

* I may be behind in getting items posted and/or graded. We're all stretched thin.   
* Still refining this class - 2nd time was Sp 22, and we all know what kinda `r emo::ji("poop")` show that was.  
* The schedule of topics and assignment items are not fixed in number, and will roll out throughout the semester as time provides. 
* Links on this page may be broken (submit a PR to fix!)_

# Let's get started. 

1. Start a learning journal. This can be on paper, or online such as Google Docs. You will send me the URL this week, I will be checking in on it regularly. Make sure I have write access so I can leave comments. 
2. [3-2-1 Bridge Activity](https://norcalbiostat.github.io/MATH315/lecture/321_Bridge.html)
